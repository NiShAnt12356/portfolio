To support the model, a robust text preprocessing pipeline was developed using tools such as BeautifulSoup, NLTK, and regex for efficient natural language processing (NLP). Furthermore, the model incorporates a Bi-LSTM architecture combined with an attention mechanism, enabling enhanced feature extraction and more accurate classification for improved predictive results.",

The solution was further optimized to deliver an impressive inference time of just 15ms on GPU, significantly reducing diagnosis time by 60%. Our innovative approach, incorporating CapsuleNet alongside tools such as Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Albumentations, earned a prestigious 14th rank in a global competition, reflecting the impact and precision of our work.",
